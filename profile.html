                    <p class="text-justify">

                        He has been involved in coaching in Ireland for over 20 years at every level from grass roots to the Senior National men's side
                        He holds a UKCC ECB Level 4 Master Coach in Elite Cricket Coaching with a Post Graduate Diploma in Personal & Professional Development from the University of Gloucester . He also holds an MSc (Masters) in Elite Cricket Coaching. He is also an ECB Qualified Tutor and Assessor, capable of delivering on UKCC Level 3 Performance Coach Courses
